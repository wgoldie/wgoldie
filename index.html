    <p>
      I'd love to get in <a href="mailto:will.goldie@mail.utoronto.ca">touch</a> with anyone who has an interest in generative design, creative coding, graphics, computation as a medium of expression, computational thinking, programming language design, and anything related to these topics.

      I'm on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/doubleugoldie">@doubleugoldie.</a>

    <p>In the past I worked as an intern at Autodesk on <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=FEDA7C6A04AF411E87DA844055C3CAA0">software</a> to talk with industrial laser cutters, and in R&d. I also got to test out some ideas about 3D printing <a href="/cube.jpeg">volumetric shapes</a> generated with GLSL shader language.

      Hopefully some more of my existing projects will make it up to this webpage soon.
