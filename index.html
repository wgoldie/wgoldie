    <h1>Will Goldie</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a student at the University of Toronto in the undergrad computer science program.   
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd love to <a href="mailto:will.goldie@mail.utoronto.ca">get in touch</a> with anyone who has an interest in generative design, creative coding, graphics, computer science as a medium of expression, computational thinking, programming language design, and anything related to these topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully some of my projects will make it up to this webpage soon. For now, close your eyes and imagine.
