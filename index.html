    <h1>Will Goldie</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a freelance software developer and student (current course University of Toronto B.Sc. Theory of Computation)
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd love to get in <a href="mailto:will.goldie@mail.utoronto.ca">touch</a> with anyone who has an interest in generative design, creative coding, graphics, computation as a medium of expression, computational thinking, programming language design, and anything related to these topics. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I do contract/freelance work in many of these areas as well as in full-stack web application development. 
      I am often willing to work pro bono or at a dramatically reduced cost for individual artists or art collectives.
    </p>
    <p>In the past I worked as an intern at Autodesk on <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=FEDA7C6A04AF411E87DA844055C3CAA0">software</a> to talk with industrial laser cutters, and in <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/dreamcatcher">R&D</a>. I also got to test out some ideas about 3D printing <a href="/cube.jpeg">volumetric shapes</a> generated with GLSL shader language.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully some more of my existing projects will make it up to this webpage soon. 
      Please check in on my Github account at <a href="https://github.com/wgoldie">github.com/wgoldie</a>.

      I'm also <a href="https://github.com/wgoldie/colorwalk">currently developing</a> <a href="http://willgoldie.me/colorwalk/">ColorWalk</a>, a new way to visualize/cognize/generate color transitions and gradients.
