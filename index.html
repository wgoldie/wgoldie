    <h1>Will Goldie</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a freelance software consultant and student. <br> (current course University of Toronto CS)
    </p>
    <p>
      I can help you or your company with the feasibility of software projects,
      identifying the most efficient and reliable tools and methods develop a piece of software,
      writing about your products,
      and many other tough problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can help you build connectives and integrations to interface with, 
      instrument, and extract data from existing software systems,
      even if their developers don't want you to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can help you plan your software projects and create specifications and scoping plans so that you can 
      hire contractors and freelancers to implement them without getting ripped off. 
      I can also implement them myself, especially MVP prototypes, with extremely fast turnaround.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently [closed for new commercial business] but please get in <a href="mailto:will.goldie@mail.utoronto.ca">touch</a> if any of this sounds valuable to you 
      - I'll be available sooner than you know.
      I am often willing to work pro bono or at a dramatically reduced rates for individual artists or art collectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please also reach out if you have an interest in generative design, 
      creative coding, graphics, computation as a medium of expression, 
      computational thinking, programming language design, and anything related to these topics. 
    </p>
    <p>In the past I worked as an intern at Autodesk on <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=FEDA7C6A04AF411E87DA844055C3CAA0">software</a> to talk with industrial laser cutters, and in <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/dreamcatcher">R&D</a>. I also got to test out some ideas about 3D printing <a href="/cube.jpeg">volumetric shapes</a> generated with GLSL shader language.
