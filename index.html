    <h1>Will Goldie</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a freelance software consultant. I specialize in considered use of AI and machine learning technology, product prototyping and inception, and computer-aided design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can help your business take advantage of recent AI and ML advances,
      as well as long-proven methods from those fields,
      without drowning you in buzzwords or making promises that current technology can't deliver on.
      By identifying key opportunities and needs in your business, we can plan AI-driven interventions
      that provide new ways of seeing and reacting to risks and opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can help you plan software projects,
      including consumer apps, SASS platforms, business-internal tools, and more.
      This process will result in development plans, specifications, and scoping documents.
      They will prepare you to to hire and manage employees or freelancers to complete your project, 
      without getting ripped off or paying for something that doesn't fulfill your needs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I can build the software you need myself,
      drawing on my own expertise and a network of skilled developers and designers.
      We specialize in fast-turnaround M.V.P prototypes.
      If you're on a tight timeline and need minimal, low-cost software ready for presentation to investors, end users, and other stakeholders, we can help.
      If you're looking for longer-term solutions, we can help there as well.
    </p>
